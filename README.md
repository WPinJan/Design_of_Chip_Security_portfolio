# Design_of_Chip_Security_portfolio

This repository contains all the labs I completed during my **Design of Chip Security** course in 2025. The topics include combinational circuit design, sequential circuit design, finite state machine (FSM), verification, synthesis, and FPGA prototyping.

We used **Verilog** throughout the course. The main tools employed were **Synopsys VCS** for simulation and **Verdi** for waveform debugging.

## ðŸ”¸ Lab List

- **Lab1** â€“ Design and verification of the message schedule module in a hash algorithm
- **Lab2** â€“ Design and verification of the complete hash algorithm
- **Lab3** â€“ FPGA prototyping of the hash algorithm
